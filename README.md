My website has an introduction page, a home page, a media page, a shop page, a frequently asked questions page, a survey page, a contact page, and a functioning site map. 

The introduction page contains a flash video and a button to enter the site. The home page contains information about our product, website, and the ingredients used to make our delicious drink. 

On the shop page, you can fill out a form and order bottles of Mangolicious right to your house. 

If you have any questions regarding our product, website, or company, you can ask them on the frequently asked questions page. We will try to answer your question, truthfully, as soon as possible. 

We want to know what you think about our product and our site. We created a survey page so you can tell us what you think and give us your opinions. Your opinions are important to us. We can use the information to improve our site. 

If you have any secretive questions for us, you can email the owner, Tahmid Mehdi, on the contact page. 

Check out our site map to see where each page links to. You can go to any page by clicking the button on the site map. 

We have a great navigation bar where you can go to any web page by clicking the buttons. 

Credits

The logo was created by Tahmid Mehdi, with the help of Adobe Photoshop. We obtained all of the other pictures from other sites. For the HTML codes, I used W3schools.com and the notes I obtained in Mr. Wheelerâ€™s Computer Skills Class for assistance. My website has links to freshmangoes.com, crfg.org, mango.org, freshmangoes.com, peertrainer.com. The buttons were created using Adobe Photoshop.
